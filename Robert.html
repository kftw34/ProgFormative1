          <p class="lead">Mobile Phones have recently had a virtually unparalleled impact on society, utilising advances in both computer software and hardware. They have succeeded in bringing the wealth of information and resources that is the internet to more people, as well as promoting and enhancing long-range communication between different people. Between 1983 and 2014 the number of global mobile phone subscriptions grew by over seven billion, enough to provide one for every person on Earth. In my opinion it is difficult to identify an application of computing technology that is more ubiquitous and useful than the humble mobile phone which so many of us use everyday.</p>
        
		  <h2>A Brief History of Mobile Phones</h2>
          <p><br><b>1973</b> - The first mobile phone was demonstrated by Mitchell and Cooper of Motorola<br>
          <br>
          <b>1979</b> - The first cellular network is established in Japan by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone<br>
          <br>
          <b>1983</b> - The first commercially available mobile phone is released, the DynaTAC 8000x<br>
          <br>
          <b>1991</b> - The second generation (2G) cell network is introduced in Finland by Radiolinja<br>
          <br>
          <b>2001</b> - 3G is launched in Japan by NTT, paving the way for further internet integration<br>
          <br>
          <b>2007</b> - The Apple iPhone is released, which would herald the introduction of true smartphones<br>
          <br>
          <b>2010</b> - LTE and WiMAX, two wireless technogies, are finally recognised as 4G<br>
          </p>
			<h2>The Rise of Mobile Phones</h2>
          <img src="http://stats.areppim.com/ressources/mobi_scurve_2017_602x461.png" alt="My Image" style="max-height: 450px" class="ml-5 mb-2 img-responsive float-right border rounded" >

          <p><br>Before the new millenium, mobile phones were much less ubiquitous than today, as shown in the graph, with less than 1 billion mobile subscriptions worldwide. In only 15 years, this number has grown to 7.5 billion, a remarkable increase previously unprecedented in the world of consumer electronics.</p>
          
          <p>This is likely due to recent advances in computing technology, as processors have been able to get smaller, cheaper and more powerful. This trend is best described in Moore's law, coined by Gordon Moore of Intel, who theorised that transisor density would double every 18 years or so. Since the 70s this has been the case, paving the way for smaller, better computers, making phones more useful, less pricy and more practical.</p>
          
          
          
          <h2>The Impact on Society</h2>
          
          <p><br>Nowadays most people have access to a phone within arm's length, using them for messaging people, work, light gaming, watching videos, posting memes, or just as a regular phone! The rise of the mobile phones has definitely made today's society more interconnected than any before it, with many people glued to social media and messaging applications. No other technogy has had such a profound effect on how people live, work and communicate in such a short space of time as the mobile phone.</p>
          
          <p>While most agree that their impact on society is profound and widespread, there is some debate as to whether the impact has been to the benefit of society. Recently there has been an uproar regarding the use of personal data and information by large companies and online technologies such as targeted advertisments collecting personal data. The efforts of companies and individuals to collect and possibly exploit personal data has undoubtedly been compounded by the current universality of mobile phones. This has further lead to encryption technolgies and privacy agreements becoming commonplace. </p>
          
          <p>Despite these concerns, many today find their mobiles indispensible, and for most people the benefits will outweigh any concerns they may have. </p>
          <h2>The Future of Mobile Phones</h2>
          <p><br>Who knows where phones will be 10 years from today? More powerful, slimmer, better screens are all pretty safe guesses. It is unlikely that a period of innovation as intense and transformative as that seen in the last 20 years is possible, with Moore's law slowing down in recent years and the normalisation of the smartphone. However, certain new research areas of computing, such as parallel processing, artificial intelligence and the 'Internet of Things' have possibly exciting implications for mobile phones. Another revolution in personal mobile computing certainly isn't out of the question.</p>
